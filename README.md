## Code
### Style
Follow the official Android code style guidelines: [http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)

### Indentation
We use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.

### Line Length
Stick within the 120 char line limit. Use line breaks to split up code according to the style guidelines.

### Whitespace
Code should not have any trailing whitespace to avoid creating unnecessary diff issues. Please setup your IDE to remove these as a save action.

### Imports
Please setup your IDE to remove all unused imports as a save action.

## Documentation

### Javadoc
Any new classes that are committed must include a class descriptor Javadoc along with:
```@author name@address.com```
Javadoc any public methods, variables and constants. Javadoc private methods where beneficial.

### Comments
Use in-line commenting to help the next developer who might be editing your code, even if it seems obvious now. Inline comments should appear on the line above the code your are commenting.
